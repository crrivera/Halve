# About Me

Hi! My name is Carlos Rivera and I am currently a graduate computer science and engineering student and teaching assistant at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/). I've been fortunate enough to have been at [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames) and Stellar Solution's [Quakefinder](https://www.quakefinder.com/).

I'm currently on the look for my next challenge (software engineering internship!). I'm always excited to meet new people so definitely feel free to drop me a line.

This site is still under construction so stay tuned! In the meantime though, here is my [resume](https://www.quakefinder.com/).
